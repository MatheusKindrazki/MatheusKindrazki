## What I'm Working On

At Arco Educação, I'm part of building educational platforms that serve thousands of schools and millions of students. Our tech stack powers everything from learning management systems to data analytics platforms that help educators make better decisions.

## Philosophy

I believe great software comes from:
- Deep understanding of problems before jumping to solutions
- Clean, maintainable code over clever complexity
- Continuous learning and sharing knowledge
- Building with empathy for users and fellow developers
- Strong fundamentals over chasing trends
