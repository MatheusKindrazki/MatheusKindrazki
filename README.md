## About

I'm a Principal Engineer focused on **frontend architecture at scale**, **microfrontends**, **design systems**, and **developer experience as a force multiplier**. My work centers on creating coherent systems that reduce cognitive load, systemic risk, and entropy — enabling multiple squads to ship with consistency and confidence.

I approach problems with analytical depth and a preference for **mechanisms over magic**: governance frameworks (RFCs/ADRs), canonical documentation, observable pipelines, and automation that makes the right thing the easy thing. I also apply AI pragmatically in production contexts — RAG orchestration, evaluation pipelines, datasets, and quality gates.

Beyond corporate engineering, I build products that matter: privacy-first tools, intelligent transcription systems, and experiences that ship.

## Core Focus Areas

**Frontend Architecture & Platform**
Microfrontends (Module Federation) • Design Systems (Iris DS) • Monorepo Architecture • Component Libraries • Build & Bundle Optimization • Runtime Performance

**Developer Experience**
CI/CD Pipelines • Tooling & Automation • Engineering Governance (RFC/ADR/DCP) • Knowledge Management (WikiJS) • Standardization & Quality Gates • Reducing Cognitive Overhead

**Applied AI & Data Systems**
RAG Orchestration (LangChain/LangGraph) • Semantic Search & Vector DBs • OCR/HTR Pipelines • Dataset Engineering & Quality Metrics (WER) • Observability (Langfuse) • Evaluation Frameworks

**Full-Stack Engineering**
React • TypeScript • Angular • Node.js • Python • PHP • GraphQL • REST APIs • PostgreSQL • Self-hosted Infrastructure

**Cloud & Infrastructure**
AWS • Azure • Docker • Coolify • Supabase (self-hosted) • Edge Functions • n8n Automations • Observability & Monitoring

## What I'm Building

### At Arco Educação

Leading technical architecture for educational platforms serving thousands of schools and millions of students:

- **Microfrontend ecosystem** with Module Federation, enabling independent squad velocity while maintaining system coherence
- **Iris Design System** integration and governance across product surfaces
- **AI-powered education tools**: RAG systems over ~10k+ document bases, automated essay correction with OCR/HTR pipelines, semantic search infrastructure
- **Developer Experience initiatives**: canonical documentation (WikiJS), RFC/ADR processes, CI/CD standardization, quality automation
- **Café com Código**: recurring engineering community ritual for knowledge sharing and technical culture building

### Side Projects

**[Remindr.AI](https://remindr.ai)** — Privacy-first desktop app for intelligent transcription, diarization, and daily memory. Built for people who think while they talk.

**Lofiever** — Ambient productivity environment (active development)

## Engineering Philosophy

I believe sustainable systems come from:

- **Coherence over cleverness** — systems should be predictable, not impressive
- **Governance as enabler** — lightweight structures (RFCs, ADRs) that prevent chaos without bureaucracy
- **DX as leverage** — remove friction and teams move faster with higher quality
- **AI as engineering** — observability, evaluation, datasets, and metrics; not magic
- **Documentation as source of truth** — canonical, versioned, discoverable
- **Pragmatic depth** — deep enough to be correct, simple enough to be maintainable

## How I Operate

I work across three layers simultaneously:

1. **Architecture & Governance** — Long-term structures that outlive individual features: contracts between systems, version strategies, risk reduction, technical debt management

2. **Platform & Tooling** — Moving the needle for entire teams: automation, pipelines, standards, templates, observability, integration

3. **Applied Technology** — Shipping real value: AI orchestration, data pipelines, frontend infrastructure, full-stack features when needed

## Public Work & Community

- **Technical Writing**: Arco Tech Blog, Medium, internal RFCs and architecture docs
- **Speaking**: Internal tech talks, meetups, engineering community events
- **Open Source**: Active on GitHub [@MatheusKindrazki](https://github.com/MatheusKindrazki)
- **Mentoring**: Technical interviews, feedback systems, engineering culture development

## Education & Background

**Software Engineering Degree**
Specialized training in Cloud Computing (AWS, Azure) and DevOps practices

**Neurodivergent (ASD Level 1)**
Analytical, visual, and systems-oriented thinking. I value clarity, structure, and operational precision.
